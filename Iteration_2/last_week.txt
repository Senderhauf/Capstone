A   B       0 == valid state

0   0       

0   1       B throws error on it's current value, sets own status to invalid, increments faultNum; 
            B calls reset on self
            After maxFaultNum reached call reset on A

1   0       A will try to reset self after maxFaultNum reached 

1   1       A will try to reset self first
