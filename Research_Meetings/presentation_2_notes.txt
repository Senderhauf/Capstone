Highlight the path of research so far:
    MQTT 
        lightweight TCP based subscribe and Publish mesaging protocol 

    Apache Spark 
        Process large volumes of streaming data using resilient distributed datasets (RDD = nodes)
        DAG - multistep operational flow control with Actions and Transformations 

    ThingsBoard.io rule engine
        Not efficient solution for programmers as the mechanics of stream composition is 
        abstracted from the user 
    
    Node.js Stream Library
        Reactive programming with Push based Streams
        Created a module for:
            Multiplexing and demultiplexing streams
            Functionally composing streams based on provided callback

    Functional Reactive Programming: REScala

    Main objective switched from 'Glueing' IOT streams together with FRP to Providing Fault
    Tolerance to existing solutions 

    Fault-Tolerant Distributed Reactive Programming: REScala

    Fault-Tolerance in the context of Rx.js
