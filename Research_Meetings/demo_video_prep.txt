Show the following cases:


	Case 1:

		AOT 1: valid

		AOT 2: valid

		Pilot: 
			send up signal until just past limit, allow for mcas to kick in
			send down signal until just past limit, allow for mcas to kick in

			also show that the pilot can push past the limit but the mcas will kick in once the pilot has stopped sending rapid signals 
			
	Case 2: 

		AOT 1: invalid 

		AOT 2: valid

		Pilot:
			send up signal until just past limit, allow for mcas to kick in
			send down signal until just past limit, allow for mcas to kick in
	
	Case 3:

		AOT 1: invalid

		AOT 2: invalid 

		Pilot: 
			send up signal just past limit
			
			bring nose angle back into valid range
			
			send down signal just past limit 
			
			bring nose angle back into valid range
			
			send down signal just past limit 

			restart aot1 and allow for the nose angle to come back into a valid range

			restart aot2

Make sure to remark on how the variance of the aot1 and aot2 sensors can affect the readings (simulate natural turbulance)
