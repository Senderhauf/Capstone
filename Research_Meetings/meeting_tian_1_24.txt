Push based vs Pull based streams

high order can lead to resource leak
	prevent by making programming first order 

How does functional reactive programming related to node stream and spark stream? They may or may not be the same thing

Arrows are in a high level view a static pipeline

Programs fail when assumptions fail

which is the best for iot
	funcitonal reactive programming 
	fixed pipeline language
	reactive (nodejs stream)

	Low rate data with many nodes


Project outline:
	1. Filter:
		research current paradigms for processing iot data and reduce to the best for our case

	2. Create:
		1. Create MQTT server + Node.js clients virtualized testing environment
		2. 

	3. Test:


	4. Refactor:
