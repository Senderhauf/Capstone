1. your grand vision

	Create a stream agnostic, purely functional Nodejs library, availalbe in npm, for supporting various streaming encodings for functional composition of streams into pipes which can calculate point based and window kpi's 

		Which would allow for Rapid prototyping of iot applicaitons 

	Use function reactive programming after Nodejs streaming proof of concept is deemed feasible

2. end of semester goals

	Exploratory analysis for FRP as a solution. 

	Create a Nodejs streaming module, using both delarative and imparative paradigms, which allow a user to compose streams into kpi calculation pipes using a notation similar to the kpi formulas. 

	Implement basic Nodejs MQTT clients with an Nodejs server(Express) backend for processing the streams into kpi calculation pipes 

	Hopefully connect this backend data processing server to the front end being designed by Team 5

	
3. technologies	
	MQTT
	Nodejs
		(using javascript over scala as it's more widely used and there is a market need for web developers to use streaming function composition)
