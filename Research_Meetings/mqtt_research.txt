	'What is MQTT?'

		Message Queue Telemetry Transport
		TCP based Subscribe and Publish messaging protocol
		Supports machine to machine interactions
		Developed by IBM
		Based on Hub and Spoke model

		Broker: acts as a gateway/server/reciever for clients
			allows for the client to send messages to and recieve messages from the broker if it is subscribed to it

			'Post Office' model
				Broker is the PostOffice and clients would be the homes it services 

		Allows for username and password auth


source2: mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html
	NOTE: mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQTT 3.1.1/3.1 message protocol

	1. Topics / Subscriptions
		
		topics used as a hierarchy similar to linux file system
			ex: sensors/COMPUTER_NAME/temperature/HARDRIVE_NAME

		wildcards
			to receive temperature info from all computers and harddrives subscribe to following:	
				sensors/+/temperature/+

			a/b/c/d
				a/b/c/d
				+/b/c/d
				a/+/c/d
				+/+/+/+

				#
				a/#
				a/b/#
				a/b/c/#
				+/b/c/#

	2. Quality of Service (QoS)
		
		3 levels of QoS
			QoS 0 (lowest), QoS 1, QoS 2 (highest)

		0: broker/client send message once, no confirmation
		1: broker/client send message @ least once, confirmation required
		2: broker/client send message excatly once, using a four step handshake

	3. Retained Messages
		
		Messages may be set to retained
		
		Broker saves messages so that when a new client subscribes they can be updated with last message rather than waiting an interminable period for the next message

	4. Clean session / Durable connections
		
		Clean session (aka clean start) flag set on connection
			if true, when a node disconnects all subscribtions and messages will NOT be saved
		
		Durable connection:
			client who's clean session flag is false

	5. Wills

		client may give broker message to send when client disconnects unexpectedly


	NOTE: messages have a topic, QoS, and retain status

	Real Time Analysis vs Real Time Visualization

	
	Real Time Analysis 
		Descriptive Statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, etc. 

		Quantitative messages: (used for general data analysis)

			Time-series: variables tracked over time (line-chart)
			
			Ranking: subdivisions ranked by relations (highest temperature of a node per hour) (bar chart)

			Part-to-whole: ratio (pie chart)

			Deviation: comparision against a reference 

			frequency distribution: (histogram)

			Correlation: relationship between two variables, x and y (scatterplot)

		Analytical Activities: (used for particular data points of interest)
			
			Retrieve Value

			Filter

			Compute Derived Value

			Find Extremum

			Sort

			Determine Range

			Characterize Distribution

			Find Anomalies

			Cluster

			Correlate

			Contextualization
