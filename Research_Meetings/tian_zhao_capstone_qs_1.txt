IoT Dashboard:
	Web or desktop based?
	What kind of data will be receiving?
		format?

Edge Device (client):
	Do we simulate the gathering of data?

Was there a specific problem that inspired you to design this capstone?


With Goyal as the main instructor, what will be your role as our capstone sponsor?



existing iot system 

collect data from sensor 
analyze in engine
archive
display 


Computing at the edge and the server

We can make a basic assumption that the client
	mqtt broker 
		publisher of the data


pick a corner case 

	analysis engine
		flexible 

		rendering and collecting are easy

		analysis is hard
			data should be real time
			high rate data is difficult 
				if we fall behind

		data comes in 
			preprocessing = problem detection
			prepare for archiving
			detect events 
				streaming analysis 
					compute fft
					total harmonic distroation
			last part it Batch processing (use spark)

			windowing computation => sliding window

		apache spark 
			base on scala
			comes with limitation
				find limiting factors


		suppose up to 100 devices of data streaming


		make web api
		accept control
			control the data analysis 

			client interested in various data anaylsis 

		many people want it to be code free

		create a development environment 
			analysis platform based on spark 

			assume outlet for stable storage
			input api for control/execution

			analysis module 

	look at mqtt, spark, how to streaming applications with spark, look at existing iot dashboard
	freeboard.io
