y = f2(f2(x))

vs 

y = (f1 o f2)(x)
	functional composition


How can we implement thingboard.io functionality through a spark only streaming composition 


Arrows
	Monads (LOOK AT THESE)
		Datastructure
		List is a monad
	promises are eager, arrows are lazy
	Can do a check before a run 
	Designed for async and not streaming
	Originally defined in Haskell

Search for something in js that implements spark stream

	Then spark functionality could be implemented in node


proc notation
	Haskell

list comprehension
	is a monad 


TODO:
	Research:
		Arrows, Monads
	JS streaming -> see file streaming
	Search for something in js that implements spark stream
	Look into Spark spark stream (research paper)
